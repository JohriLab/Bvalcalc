Tailoring Parameters
=========================

When using **Bvalcalc** to study populations beyond the pre-built templates, it's important to tailor the popgen parameters to your population of interest.

To save a local copy of one of the templates, see :doc:`Generate Parameters <../introduction/generate_params>` and open up the Params.py file in your text editor of choice.

Core parameters
----------------
``x`` 
    Scaling factor that modifies ``N``, ``u``, ``r``, and ``g``. Keep as 1 for empirical analysis, only relevant for calculating B to compare against rescaled simulations
``Nanc``
    Ancestral population size, often reported in literature. Can be roughly estimated from nucleotide diversity at neutrally evolving sites, given a mutation rate and no demography (`Nanc = pi/4u`).
``r``
    Recombination (crossover) mean rate per bp, per generation (sex-averaged), often reported in literature from direct measurement (recombination in pedigrees) or inferred from sequence data. Note you can add a crossover rate map that can modify ``r`` across the genome with ``--rec_map``. 
``u``   
    Mutation mean rate per bp, per generation, often reported in literature from mutation accumulation experiments. Note that the point mutation rate is typically used, though all mutation types with selective effects may contribute to BGS similarly, if considering different mutation types with different DFEs, see :doc:`Multiple DFEs <../guides/multiple_dfes>`.  
``g`` 
    Gene conversion initiation mean rate per bp, per generation. Note that on occasion the ``g * k`` value is reported in the literature rather than the *initiation* rate, in which case, the value should be divided by the tract length (``k``). You can add a gc initiation rate map that can modify `g` across the genome with ``--gc_map``.
``k``
    Gene conversion tract length (bp). Note that **Bvalcalc** takes only a single mean value and so does not model a distribution of tract lengths.

DFE parameters
----------------

A distribution of fitness effects (DFE) describes the probability of different selective effects for new mutations when they arise.
**Bvalcalc** models a discretized deleterious DFE consisting of four uniform distributions ranging from effectively neutral (``f0``), to strongly deleterious (``f3``); beneficial mutations are currently not supported. 

See Figure 1 in `Johri et al. 2020 <https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.303002>`_ for a more detailed explanation of the discretized DFE.

To specify a DFE, provide ``f0``, ``f1``, ``f2``, ``f3`` proportions that represent the DFE for all annotated regions in the :doc:`BED/GFF input <../introduction/bedgff_input>`. Note that the proportions must sum to 1, i.e. ``f0+f1+f2+f3 = 1``.


``f0`` 
    Proportion of effectively neutral mutations with `0 <= | 2*Nanc*s | < 1`.
    
    Note that `2*Nanc*s < 5` does not contribute to BGS, see `Johri et al. 2020 <https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.303002>`_, **Bvalcalc** will exclude the f0 proportion from BGS calculations.
``f1``
    Proportion of weakly deleterious mutations with `1 <= | 2*Nanc*s | < 10`
``f2`` 
    Proportion of moderately deleterious mutations with `10 <= | 2*Nanc*s | < 100`
``f3``
    Proportion of strongly deleterious mutations with `100 <= | 2*Nanc*s |` 
``h``
    Dominance coefficient of selected alleles. Keep at 0.5 (additive effects) unless literature suggests otherwise

DFE parameters may be reported in the literature as a gamma distribution. **Bvalcalc** can take gamma distribution parameters which is converted to a discretized DFE to overwrite ``f0``, ``f1``, ``f2``, ``f3`` when ``--gamma_dfe`` is specified:

``mean, shape, proportion_synonymous``
    The mean and shape parameters of the gamma DFE, and the proportion of strictly neutral sites in the annotated regions (e.g. synonymous in exon regions). 


Demography
-----------

Historical population size change as a single step-function can be accounted for with **Bvalcalc** by adding the ``--pop_change`` flag, and setting the following parameters:

``Ncur`` 
    Current population size, i.e. in the current epoch.

``time_of_change`` 
    Time in ``Nanc`` generations ago that effective population size went from ``Nanc`` to ``Ncur``.

Selfing species
---------------

Self-fertilizing (selfing) species have different evolutionary dynamics from obligate outcrossers which impact BGS (i.e., B).

The parameters file can be modified for selfing populations by altering population size (``Nanc/Ncur``), crossover rate (``r``), gene conversion rate (``g``) and dominance coefficient by an additional parameter: ``f``, which is Wright's inbreeding coefficient (F). F can be calculated from the selfing rate (F = S/(2-S)), see `Nordborg 2000 <https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/154.2.923>`_. Note that the ``arabidopsis`` and ``pfalciparum`` default templates have the inbreeding parameter included.

For analysis of selfing populations, we recommend tailoring parameters from the ``selfing`` template.
